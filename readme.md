#Meteor JS ToDo App

**Honestly**
Seriously, is anybody going to read this writeup for my Meteor ToDo App????

**But Since You're Still Reading...**
This is just another demo app in my constant never ending struggle to get my daily JavaScript framework fix.  I recently discovered that I could use Angular with Meteor JS and I couldn't help myself.  I made my way over to the Meteor JS website and started working on the ToDo app tutorial.  This repo uses Blaze (not Angular).  But once I get the basics of Meteor down then I'll investigate using it with Angular 2.
